# blackjack

This is the first project that I am building with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
I have learned the basics of HTML and CSS and I am in the middle of learning Javascript.
I think this project will give me a good start to putting together all the knowledge that I have so far.

This website will hold a Blackjack game that has a dealer and the user.
The player's and dealer's hands should populate by themselves when the page is loaded. 
The player will then have the option to 'Hit' or 'Stay', I will add the option to 'Split' once I learn how that works in the game of Blackjack.

Once the player decides to stay or if their card count goes over 21, the dealer will then reveal the first dealt card and draw more cards until they either have gotten a higher card count than the player or the dealer goes over 21.
